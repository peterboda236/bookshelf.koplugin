# Bookshelf micro-modules

Each `.lua` file here is one micro-module: a small read-only info panel shown in
the hero grid and the start menu. The file returns a spec table:

```lua
return {
    key   = "my_module",          -- stable id stored in user menus (never change)
    title = _("My module"),       -- shown in the Add picker
    summary = _("Open-Meteo. Needs internet."), -- one line under the title in the
                                  -- picker: data source + connectivity
                                  -- ("… Works offline." / "Needs internet.")
    -- render(width, scale_pct, preview, avail_h, refresh, shape, entry) -> widget | nil
    render = function(width, scale_pct, preview, avail_h, refresh, shape, entry) ... end,
    on_tap = function(ctx) ... end,   -- optional tap action
    keep_open = true,                 -- optional: tap acts without closing the menu
                                      -- (or a function(ctx) -> bool, resolved at tap time)
    wants_minute_tick = true,         -- optional: re-render every minute (clocks)
    show_settings = function(ctx) ... end, -- optional settings dialog
}
```

## The one thing to understand: who sizes your card

**The host owns SIZE. You own CONTENT.** The hero grid renders your module into
a cell and then *grows or shrinks the whole card* (by re-rendering you at
different `scale_pct`) until it fills its cell, clipping as a hard backstop. So
you do **not** write your own font loop — render once at the `scale_pct` you're
handed, and the host makes it fit. This is why every module looks right at every
cell size without each author solving it again.

Use the shared kit to size fonts and build common pieces:

```lua
local Kit = require("lib/bookshelf_module_kit")
```

- `Kit.sc(scale_pct)` → `function(n)` — scaled, rounded pixel size (floored at 1).
- `Kit.face(size, scale_pct, opts)` → a `cfont` face scaled by `scale_pct`
  (`opts` = `{bold=true}` / `{italic=true}`; returns `face[, bold]`).
- `Kit.fitText{ text, size, scale_pct, width, max_h, fgcolor, bgcolor, align, opts }`
  → a `TextBoxWidget` for a flexible text block (see the advanced path).
- `Kit.valueCard{ width, scale_pct, heading, value, suffix, bar, sub, context }`
  → the standard "heading + big value + bar + sub + context" stat card (what
  reading_goal and reading_stats use — match it for visual consistency).
- `Kit.shape(width, avail_h)` → `"wide"` / `"tall"` / `"square"` (see aspect).
- `Kit.COLOR_PRIMARY` / `Kit.COLOR_MUTED` / `Kit.CARD_BG` — the shared colour
  roles (primary = the interesting content; muted = headings/hints/timestamps;
  CARD_BG = the grey a `TextBoxWidget` must paint on so it isn't a white bar).

### Simple path (most modules)

Render your content at `scale_pct` (size every font via `Kit.sc`/`Kit.face`) at
its natural height. The host grows/shrinks the card to fill the cell and clips
anything that still overflows. That's it — no `avail_h`, no fit loop. `weather`,
`shelf_size`, `random_unread`, `clock` work this way.

### Advanced path (height-aware / flexible text)

If you have a long text block that should fill the cell and truncate gracefully
at the extreme, render it with `Kit.fitText` and pass `max_h` = the room left in
the cell:

```lua
render = function(width, scale_pct, preview, avail_h, refresh, shape)
    local Kit = require("lib/bookshelf_module_kit")
    local fixed = buildHeaderEtc(...)            -- the non-flexible parts
    local max_h = (avail_h and avail_h > 0)
        and math.max(1, avail_h - fixed:getSize().h) or nil
    local body = Kit.fitText{ text = longText, size = 16, scale_pct = scale_pct,
        width = math.max(50, width), max_h = max_h }
    return VerticalGroup:new{ align = "left", fixed, body }
end
```

`fitText` reports its **natural** height when the text fits within `max_h` (so
the host's grow can still enlarge the font), and ellipsis-clamps to `max_h` only
at the extreme. `quote_of_day` and `trivia` use this for the quote body / the
question. Do **not** run your own scale loop — it fights the host's.

### Aspect (optional `shape`)

`render`'s 6th arg `shape` is `"wide"`, `"tall"`, or `"square"` (from the cell's
aspect). Use it to pick a *layout* (not just a font size) — e.g. lay two columns
side-by-side in a wide cell, stacked otherwise. Derive it yourself where the host
might not pass it: `shape = shape or Kit.shape(width, avail_h)`. Most modules
ignore it and still fit via the size engine; see `reading_stats` for a reference
reflow.

## `render` arguments

- `width` — inner width (px) for your content.
- `scale_pct` — the font scale to size against (`100` = normal). The host
  raises/lowers it to fit your card; size every font with it via `Kit.sc`/`Kit.face`.
- `preview` — `true` only in the Add picker; render a compact thumbnail and (see
  below) do NOT start any network fetch.
- `avail_h` — the cell height (px) the host wants filled, or `nil` (start menu /
  no height constraint). Only the advanced path needs it.
- `refresh` — see **Refreshing after async work**.
- `shape` — see **Aspect** above.
- `entry` — the hero/menu entry table for THIS card (or `nil` in the picker
  preview). Lets a module store and read PER-INSTANCE config on its own entry,
  so the same module key can appear multiple times with different settings
  (see **Per-instance config** below). Most modules ignore it.

## Refreshing after async work

If your module loads data asynchronously (a network fetch) and must redraw when
it lands, **capture the `refresh` callback in `render` and call it** from your
async completion:

```lua
local _refresh  -- module upvalue
...
render = function(width, scale_pct, preview, avail_h, refresh, shape)
    _refresh = refresh
    if needFetch() and not preview then
        fetchAsync(function(ok) if ok and _refresh then _refresh() end end)
    end
    return buildWidget()
end,
```

`refresh()` re-renders only *your* card and scopes the e-ink update to it.

**Never use `StartMenu._live` / `StartMenu._live:_reload()`, and never call
`UIManager:setDirty(...)` yourself.** `StartMenu._live` only exists while the
start menu is open — in the hero grid it is nil, so your refresh silently no-ops
there. The `refresh` arg works in both. This is enforced by
`tests/_test_module_contract.lua`, which fails the suite if any module
references `StartMenu._live`. The same applies to taps/settings: rely on the
automatic reload after a `keep_open` tap, and call `ctx.menu:_reload()` from
`show_settings`.

`refresh` may be `nil` if an older host renders you, so guard:
`if _refresh then _refresh() end`.

Set `wants_minute_tick = true` if your card shows wall-clock time (a clock): the
hero re-renders it once a minute (scoped) so it stays current. Read the time in
`render` as usual.

## Per-instance config (optional)

A module that should be addable multiple times with different settings (e.g. the
`action` module) stores its config as extra fields ON its entry, not in the
global `micromodule_<key>_*` store. The hero `sanitize` preserves unknown fields,
so they round-trip. Read them from the `entry` render arg; mutate them in
`on_tap`/`show_settings` via `ctx.entry` and persist with `ctx.save()` (saves the
host's list and reloads this card). To configure a module interactively at add
time, declare `on_add = function(host_ctx, done)`: gather fields and call
`done(fields)` to merge them into the new entry, or `done(nil)` to cancel. Hosts
that don't recognise `on_add` just insert the bare entry. See `action.lua`.

## No blocking work on render

`render` runs on every menu/hero paint, on the UI thread. **Never block it** —
no synchronous network, no slow sqlite. Cache slow reads behind a TTL (see
`reading_stats.lua`), and do network fetches in a `UIManager:scheduleIn` task
that calls `refresh()` when it lands. **Guard network behind `not preview`** —
the Add picker renders *every* registered module's preview, so an unguarded
fetch fires a burst of network calls (and has crashed the picker before). A
broken `render` is `pcall`'d and skipped, so it won't take down the menu — but a
blocking one will freeze the UI.

## `summary`

A one-line string shown under the title in the Add picker, stating where the
data comes from and whether it needs internet:
`"Open-Meteo. Needs internet."`, `"Device clock. Works offline."`,
`"From your library. Works offline."`. Required for shipped modules (the
contract test checks for it).

## `on_tap` / `show_settings`

`on_tap(ctx)` receives `ctx = { bw = <bookshelf widget>, menu = <start menu> }`.
By default a tap closes the menu then runs `on_tap`. With `keep_open = true` the
menu stays open: `on_tap(ctx)` runs, then the card reloads **automatically** — do
NOT call `ctx.menu:_reload()` yourself inside `on_tap`. `keep_open` may be a
`function(ctx) -> bool` evaluated at tap time. `show_settings(ctx)` adds a
"Module settings…" row to the long-press dialog; store settings via
`require("lib/bookshelf_settings_store")` under `micromodule_<key>_*` keys (see
`clock.lua`). The loader exports `menu_generation`, a counter bumped once per
menu open that modules may key per-open caches on.

## Colours

Take colours from `Kit.COLOR_PRIMARY` / `Kit.COLOR_MUTED` (or the equivalents on
`lib/bookshelf_start_menu_modules`) rather than hardcoding Blitbuffer constants,
so every card reads the same and a future contrast control tunes them in one
place. `COLOR_MUTED` is a deliberately dark grey (0x55) — a lighter grey fails on
weaker e-ink panels. A `TextBoxWidget` paints an opaque background, so set its
`bgcolor = Kit.CARD_BG` (fitText does this for you) or the text sits on a white
bar.

## Translations

Wrap user-visible strings in `_("...")` with a string **literal** — the file has
`_ = require("lib/bookshelf_i18n").gettext` in scope, and the `.pot` is extracted
by scanning for literal `_("...")` calls. `_()` on a variable is NOT extracted.
For locale-aware dates use `os.date("%B")` rather than a hand-rolled name table
(see `clock.lua`).

## Register the key

Add your file's `key` to the `expected_keys` table in
`tests/_test_start_menu_modules.lua` (keys are a stable API — saved user menus
reference modules by key). New modules are welcome as drop-in contributions: one
file here, the key in that test, a `summary`, and the refresh rule above (also
test-enforced).
