-- bookshelf_scaled_cover_cache.lua
-- LRU of scaled cover bbs, keyed by filepath only ("canonical-dim"
-- caching). One entry per book, sized to the LARGEST render dims seen
-- across hero / shelf / expanded-shelf in this session.
local logger = require("logger")
--
-- Why filepath-only: the same book renders into slots of different
-- dimensions across the UI:
--   * hero cover     (~500 × 750 typical)
--   * standard shelf (~250 × 375 typical)
--   * expanded shelf (slot_h grown by row budget; slot_w usually
--                     unchanged but can shrink on small screens)
--
-- A (filepath, w, h) cache key produced 2-3 entries per book and
-- defeated cross-mode hits — hero ↔ shelf transitions and
-- expanded ↔ standard toggles missed entirely. With a single
-- canonical entry per book, consumers below the canonical size let
-- ImageWidget downscale at paint time (MuPDF, Kindle-safe in this
-- direction — the corruption was upscale-specific).
--
-- Put policy: prefer-larger. On put, if an existing entry has at
-- least as many pixels as the incoming bb, the incoming bb is freed
-- and the existing entry kept. If the incoming bb is larger, it
-- replaces. This means the FIRST consumer (often shelf) seeds the
-- cache at its size; HERO's later put overwrites with bigger; shelf
-- thereafter reads the larger hero bb and downscales. Stable.
--
-- Get returns whatever bb is cached. Consumers check the returned
-- bb's dimensions: if cached >= target in both axes, use it (with
-- ImageWidget downscale when smaller); if cached < target, fall
-- through to a fresh decode+scale (which will then replace the
-- cache entry per the prefer-larger rule).
--
-- Lifetime: the cache holds a strong reference to each cached bb.
-- Callers pass to ImageWidget with image_disposable=false. When the
-- cache drops an entry (eviction or prefer-larger replace) it just
-- nils its own reference — it does NOT call bb:free(). Other live
-- ImageWidgets may still hold the bb (e.g. a shelf SpineWidget whose
-- cover entry got upgraded to hero dims when the user tapped that
-- book into the hero); explicit free would yank C memory out from
-- under those widgets and the next partial repaint would render
-- garbage pixels. Blitbuffer sets up an ffi.gc finalizer at allocate
-- time (see ffi/blitbuffer.lua setAllocated(1)), so the C memory is
-- reclaimed automatically when the last Lua reference goes away.
-- Slight memory-reclaim latency, but no use-after-free.
--
-- clear() also doesn't free explicitly — it just drops the cache's
-- references and lets GC do its thing. Existing widgets that are
-- still holding bbs keep working.
--
-- Invalidation: none required during a session — BookInfoManager
-- only re-extracts thumbnails on user-initiated metadata refresh
-- (out of band; bookshelf doesn't poke this cache from those paths).
